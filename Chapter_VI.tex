\begin{problem}{VI.1.7}
	Let $R$ be an integral domain, and let $M = R \oplus A$ be a free $R$-module. Let $K$ be the field of fractions of $R$, and view $M$ as a subset of $V = K \oplus A$ in the evident way. Prove that a subset $S \subseteq M$ is linearly independent in $M$ (over $R$) if and only if it is linearly independent in $V$ (over $K$). Conclude that the rank of $M$ (as an $R$-module) equals the dimension of $V$ (as a $K$-vector space). Prove that if $S$ generates $M$ over $R$, then it generates $V$ over $K$. Is the converse true?
\end{problem}

\begin{proof} \
	
	 \textbf{Linear independence:} Suppose $S \subseteq M$ is linearly independent over $R$. Take a finite linear combination in $V$:
	\[
	\sum_{i=1}^n c_i s_i = 0, \quad s_i \in S, \ c_i \in K.
	\]
	Write each $c_i = r_i/d_i$ with $r_i, d_i \in R$ and $d_i \neq 0$. Let $D = \prod_{i=1}^n d_i \in R \setminus \{0\}$. Multiply the equation by $D$ to eliminate denominators:
	\[
	\sum_{i=1}^n \left(D c_i\right) s_i = \sum_{i=1}^n \left(r_i \frac{D}{d_i}\right) s_i = 0 \quad \text{in } M.
	\]
	Since $S$ is linearly independent over $R$, each coefficient $r_i \frac{D}{d_i}$ must vanish, so $c_i = 0$ for all $i$. Thus $S$ is linearly independent over $K$ in $V$.
	
	 Conversely, if $S$ is linearly independent over $K$, then any $R$-linear combination is also a $K$-linear combination. Therefore, $S$ is linearly independent over $R$.  
	
	 \textbf{Rank and dimension:} By the previous argument, maximal linearly independent subsets of $M$ and $V$ correspond exactly, so
	\[
	\text{rank}_R(M) = \dim_K(V).
	\]
	
	 \textbf{Generating sets:} Suppose $S$ generates $M$ over $R$. Take $v \in V$, and write $v = \sum_i c_i s_i$ with $c_i \in K$, $s_i \in S$. Write $c_i = r_i/d_i$ with $r_i,d_i \in R$ and $d_i \neq 0$, and let $D = \prod_i d_i$. Then $Dv \in M$, and since $S$ generates $M$, we have
	\[
	Dv = \sum_i r_i' s_i, \quad r_i' \in R.
	\]
	Divide by $D$ to write $v = \sum_i (r_i'/D) s_i \in \text{span}_K(S)$. Hence $S$ generates $V$ over $K$.
	
	 \textbf{Converse:} The converse is false. For example, let $R = \mathbb{Z}$, $K = \mathbb{Q}$, $M = \mathbb{Z}$, $V = \mathbb{Q}$, and $S = \{1/2\} \subset V$. Then $S$ generates $V$ over $\mathbb{Q}$, but $S$ does not generate $M$ over $\mathbb{Z}$.  
	

\begin{problem}{VI.1.8}
	Let $R$ be an integral domain, and let $A,B$ be sets. Prove that 
	\[
	F^R(A) \cong F^R(B) \quad \iff  \quad A \cong B.
	\]
\end{problem}

\begin{proof} \
	
	 $(\Rightarrow)$ Suppose $F^R(A) \cong F^R(B)$ as $R$-modules. Let $\phi: F^R(A) \to F^R(B)$ be an $R$-module isomorphism. Recall the universal property of free modules:
	\[
	\begin{tikzcd}
		A \arrow[r,"f"] \arrow[d,"\iota_A"'] & M \\
		F^R(A) \arrow[ru,"\tilde f"'] &
	\end{tikzcd}
	\]
	
	 Since $\phi$ is an isomorphism, the set $\phi(\iota_A(A)) \subset F^R(B)$ is linearly independent over $R$. By Proposition 1.9, all bases of a free module over an integral domain have the same cardinality. Therefore,
	\[
	|A| = |\phi(\iota_A(A))| = |B|,
	\]
	so $A \cong B$ as sets.
	
	 $(\Leftarrow)$ If $A \cong B$, then there exists a bijection $f: A \to B$. By the universal property of free modules, $f$ extends uniquely to an $R$-module isomorphism $\tilde f: F^R(A) \to F^R(B)$, so
	\[
	F^R(A) \cong F^R(B).
	\]
	
	 Therefore, $F^R(A) \cong F^R(B)$ if and only if $A \cong B$.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{VI.1.10}
	Let $R$ be a commutative ring, and let 
	\[
	F = R^{\oplus B} = \{ \alpha : B \to R \mid \alpha(b) \neq 0 \text{ for only finitely many } b \in B \}
	\] 
	be a free $R$-module. Let $\mathfrak{m}$ be a maximal ideal of $R$, and let $k = R/\mathfrak{m}$ be the quotient field. Prove that
	\[
	F/\mathfrak{m}F \cong k^{\oplus B}
	\]
	as $k$-vector spaces.
\end{problem}

\begin{proof} \
	
	 Define the canonical projection
	\[
	\pi : R \longrightarrow k = R/\mathfrak{m}, \quad r \mapsto r + \mathfrak{m}.
	\]
	
	 This induces a map on the direct sum:
	\[
	\tilde{\pi} : F = R^{\oplus B} \longrightarrow k^{\oplus B}, \quad \alpha \mapsto \big(b \mapsto \pi(\alpha(b))\big) = ( \alpha(b) + \mathfrak{m} )_{b \in B}.
	\]
	
	 The map $\tilde{\pi}$ is $R$-linear, and its kernel consists of all functions $\alpha: B \to R$ whose values lie in $\mathfrak{m}$:
	\[
	\ker(\tilde{\pi}) = \{ \alpha \in R^{\oplus B} \mid \alpha(b) \in \mathfrak{m} \text{ for all } b \in B \} = \mathfrak{m}F.
	\]
	
	 By the First Isomorphism Theorem for modules (III, 5.16), we then have
	\[
	F/\mathfrak{m}F \cong \mathrm{Im}(\tilde{\pi}) = k^{\oplus B}.
	\]
	
	 Since $k^{\oplus B}$ is naturally a $k$-vector space, we conclude
	\[
	F/\mathfrak{m}F \cong k^{\oplus B}
	\]
	as $k$-vector spaces, as required.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{1.11}
	Prove that every commutative ring $R$ satisfies the IBN property.
\end{problem}

\begin{proof} \
	
 	Let $S \subseteq M$ be linearly independent, and let $B \subseteq M$ be a maximal linearly independent subset.  
	
	Write each $s \in S$ as a finite $R$-linear combination of elements of $B$:
	\[
	s = \sum_{b \in B_s} r_b b, \quad r_b \in R, \ B_s \subseteq B \text{ finite}.
	\]
	Let
	\[
	I := \langle r_b \mid s \in S, b \in B_s \rangle \subseteq R
	\]
	be the ideal generated by all coefficients appearing in elements of $S$.  
	
	If $I = R$, then $1 \in I$ and some combination of elements of $S$ already expresses a linear combination equal to an element of $B$, so $|S| \le |B|$ trivially.  
	
 Otherwise, $I \neq R$. By Proposition V.3.5, there exists a maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m} \supseteq I$. Let
	\[
	k := R/\mathfrak{m}
	\]
	be the quotient field, and consider the quotient module
	\[
	M/\mathfrak{m} M.
	\]
	
 By Exercise 1.10, we have an isomorphism of $k$-vector spaces
	\[
	M/\mathfrak{m} M \cong k^{\oplus B}.
	\]
	
	The images of $S$ and $B$ in $M/\mathfrak{m}M$ are
	\[
	\overline{S} \subseteq M/\mathfrak{m}M, \quad \overline{B} \subseteq M/\mathfrak{m}M.
	\]
	
 By construction, $\overline{S}$ is linearly independent over $k$, and $\overline{B}$ is a basis of $M/\mathfrak{m}M$ over $k$. Since $k$ is a field (an integral domain), the IBN property for vector spaces implies
	\[
	|\overline{S}| \leq |\overline{B}| \implies |S| \leq |B|.
	\]
	
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{VI.3.16}
	Claim:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $\chi_K$ is an Euler characteristic, that is,
		\[
		\chi_K(V_\bullet)=\sum_i (-1)^i [H_i(V_\bullet)].
		\]
		
		\item $\chi_K$ is universal: if $G$ is an abelian group and 
		$\delta$ assigns to each finite-dimensional vector space an element
		of $G$ such that $\delta(V)=\delta(V')$ if $V\cong V'$ and
		$\delta(V/U)=\delta(V)-\delta(U)$ for short exact sequences,
		then $\delta$ induces a unique group homomorphism
		\[
		K(k\text{-Vect}^f)\longrightarrow G
		\]
		mapping $\chi_K(V_\bullet)$ to
		\[
		\chi_G(V_\bullet)=\sum_i (-1)^i\delta(V_i).
		\]
		
		\item In particular, $\delta=\dim$ induces a homomorphism
		\[
		K(k\text{-Vect}^f)\longrightarrow \mathbb{Z}
		\]
		sending $\chi_K(V_\bullet)$ to the classical Euler characteristic
		$\chi(V_\bullet)=\sum_i (-1)^i \dim(V_i)$.
		
		\item This homomorphism is an isomorphism.
	\end{itemize}
\end{problem}

\begin{proof} \
	
	 \textbf{(1) $\chi_K$ is an Euler characteristic.}
	
	Let $V_\bullet$ be a bounded complex of finite-dimensional
	$k$-vector spaces. For each $i$, we have short exact sequences
	\[
	0 \to Z_i \to V_i \to B_{i-1} \to 0
	\]
	and
	\[
	0 \to B_i \to Z_i \to H_i(V_\bullet) \to 0.
	\]
	
	 In the Grothendieck group these give
	\[
	[V_i]=[Z_i]+[B_{i-1}]
	\]
	and
	\[
	[Z_i]=[B_i]+[H_i(V_\bullet)].
	\]
	
	 Substituting,
	\[
	[V_i]=[B_i]+[H_i(V_\bullet)]+[B_{i-1}].
	\]
	
	 Multiply by $(-1)^i$ and sum over $i$. The $[B_i]$
	terms cancel telescopically, yielding
	\[
	\sum_i (-1)^i [V_i]
	=
	\sum_i (-1)^i [H_i(V_\bullet)].
	\]
	
	 Hence
	\[
	\chi_K(V_\bullet)=\sum_i (-1)^i [H_i(V_\bullet)].
	\]
	
	\medskip
	
	 \textbf{(2) Universality.}
	
	Let $\delta$ satisfy the stated properties. Because
	$\delta(V)=\delta(U)+\delta(W)$ for every short exact sequence,
	$\delta$ respects the defining relations of the Grothendieck group.
	Hence it induces a unique group homomorphism
	\[
	\Phi_\delta : K(k\text{-Vect}^f)\to G
	\]
	with
	\[
	\Phi_\delta([V])=\delta(V).
	\]
	
	 Therefore,
	\[
	\Phi_\delta(\chi_K(V_\bullet))
	=
	\sum_i (-1)^i \delta(V_i)
	=
	\chi_G(V_\bullet).
	\]
	
	 Uniqueness follows from the universal property of the quotient.
	
	\medskip
	
	 \textbf{(3) The case $\delta=\dim$.}
	
	The dimension function is invariant under isomorphism and additive
	on short exact sequences. Hence it induces a homomorphism
	\[
	\Phi : K(k\text{-Vect}^f)\to \mathbb{Z}
	\]
	with
	\[
	\Phi([V])=\dim_k(V).
	\]
	
	 Consequently,
	\[
	\Phi(\chi_K(V_\bullet))
	=
	\sum_i (-1)^i \dim(V_i),
	\]
	the classical Euler characteristic.
	
	\medskip
	
	 \textbf{(4) $\Phi$ is an isomorphism.}
	
	Every finite-dimensional vector space satisfies
	\[
	V\cong k^{\oplus n}
	\]
	for a uniquely determined $n=\dim V$ (IBN for fields).
	Thus in the Grothendieck group,
	\[
	[V]=n[k].
	\]
	
	 Hence $K(k\text{-Vect}^f)$ is generated by $[k]$,
	so it is cyclic. Since
	\[
	\Phi([k])=\dim(k)=1,
	\]
	the map $\Phi$ is surjective. If $\Phi(n[k])=0$,
	then $n=0$, so $\ker\Phi=0$.
	
	 Therefore $\Phi$ is an isomorphism, and
	\[
	K(k\text{-Vect}^f)\cong \mathbb{Z}.
	\]
\end{proof}
